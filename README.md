# Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

1. **contracts:** Smart contracts written in Solidity
2. **frontend:** Web application built using React and Web3.js
3. **scripts:** Deployment and testing scripts
4. **tests:** Unit and integration tests for smart contracts and frontend

# Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are written in Solidity and are responsible for managing the asteroid mining operations. The # 

# contracts include:

1. **AsteroidToken.sol:** Token contract for asteroid resources
2. **MiningContract.sol:** Contract for managing mining operations
3. **DistributionContract.sol:** Contract for distributing resources among stakeholders
