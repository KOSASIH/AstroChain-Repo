## Getting Started

To get started with AstroChain, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Yarn (version 1.22 or higher)
- Hardhat (version 2.6.4 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   1. git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/AstroChain-Repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
1. cd AstroChain-Repo
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
1. yarn install
```

4. Compile smart contracts:

```bash
1. yarn compile
```

5. Start the application:

```bash
1. yarn start
```

# Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

1. **contracts:** Smart contracts written in Solidity
2. **frontend:** Web application built using React and Web3.js
3. **scripts:** Deployment and testing scripts
4. **tests:** Unit and integration tests for smart contracts and frontend

# Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are written in Solidity and are responsible for managing the asteroid mining operations. The # 

# contracts include:

1. **AsteroidToken.sol:** Token contract for asteroid resources
2. **MiningContract.sol:** Contract for managing mining operations
3. **DistributionContract.sol:** Contract for distributing resources among stakeholders

# Frontend

The frontend is built using React and Web3.js, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the smart contracts. The frontend is organized into the following components:

1. **App.js:** Main application component
2. **Mining.js:** Component for managing mining operations
3. **Distribution.js:** Component for distributing resources among stakeholders

# Testing

Testing is an essential part of the development process. The project uses Hardhat for testing smart contracts and Jest for testing the frontend.

1. Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
1. yarn test
```

2. To run unit tests for smart contracts:

```bash
1. yarn test:unit
```

3. To run integration tests for smart contracts and frontend:

```bash
1. yarn test:integration
```

# Deployment

The project is deployed using Hardhat's deployment scripts.

1. Deploying to Testnet

To deploy the smart contracts to the testnet:

```bash
1. yarn deploy:testnet
```

2. Deploying to Mainnet

To deploy the smart contracts to the mainnet:

```bash
1. yarn deploy:mainnet
```
